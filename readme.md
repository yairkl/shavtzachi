# Shavtzachi (שבצחי) - Shift Scheduler

Shavtzachi is a fully serverless, constraints-based shift scheduler. It runs entirely in your browser and stores all data in **your own Google Spreadsheet** - there is no backend and no database to host.

Live app: https://yairkl.github.io/shavtzachi/

## Features

- Automated greedy scheduling that respects skills, cooldowns, post exclusions, unavailability and a fairness history score.
- Real-time conflict detection while editing a draft schedule.
- Soldiers, posts and unavailability management, with CSV/XLSX import and export.
- Excel export of the final schedule.
- Your data stays in your Google Sheet; sign in with Google to connect.

## Tech stack

React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Radix/shadcn UI, Google Identity Services + Google Sheets API. Deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev      # local dev server
npm test         # unit tests (Vitest)
npm run build    # production build
```

### Tests

- `npm test` - unit tests, including an in-memory fake of the Google Sheets API (`src/tests/helpers/fakeSheets.js`) used to test hand-edited and imported spreadsheets end to end.
- `npm run test:e2e` - real-browser tests (Playwright + Chromium) of the built app against that same fake, in `frontend/e2e/`. First time: `npx playwright install chromium`. Add new scenarios to `e2e/*.e2e.test.js` using the helpers in `e2e/helpers/harness.js` (`startApp`, `open(tabs)`, `toast`).

Pull requests run both in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

Pushes to `master` run the tests, build the app and deploy it to GitHub Pages (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).

## Google sign-in

The app uses the OAuth client configured in `frontend/src/services/auth.js`. Google deletes OAuth clients that are unused for about six months, so sign in to the app now and then to keep it active. See the open issues for planned OAuth hardening.

## Roadmap

See the [issue tracker](https://github.com/yairkl/shavtzachi/issues).
